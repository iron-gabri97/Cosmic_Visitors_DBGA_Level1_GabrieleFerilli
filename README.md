# Cosmic_Visitors_DBGA_Level1_GabrieleFerilli
I created my first game for the DBGA level 1 project. 
I implemented Scriptable Objects for enemy UFOs and the UFO Boss. 
I created a script for a level generator and other scripts for the UI Manager and Player Input.
I used the interfaces for the IDamageable and IShooter scripts.
I also used the MonoSingleton pattern design.
